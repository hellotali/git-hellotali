## 🧠 Cognitive Assessment

**Cognitive assessment** refers to the systematic evaluation of a person's mental functions—how well their brain is working. It is used to measure abilities such as memory, attention, language, problem-solving, and executive function.

### Common Areas Measured in a Cognitive Assessment

| Cognitive Domain       | What It Evaluates                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory**             | Short-term, long-term, and working memory           |
| **Attention**          | Ability to focus and shift focus between tasks      |
| **Language**           | Understanding, speaking, reading, writing           |
| **Executive Function** | Planning, decision-making, flexible thinking        |
| **Visuospatial Skills**| Recognizing patterns, drawing, navigating space     |
| **Processing Speed**   | How quickly information is taken in and used        |

### Tools and Formats

- **Standardized Tests**:  
  - Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  
  - Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  
  - Trail Making Test (TMT)  
  - Clock Drawing Test

- **Digital Assessments**:  
  - Tablet or app-based quizzes  
  - AI-analyzed speech or writing patterns  
  - Game-like tasks measuring reaction time or memory

### Purpose of Cognitive Assessment

- Screen for cognitive decline (e.g., dementia, Alzheimer’s)
- Track cognitive changes over time
- Support diagnosis for mental health conditions or brain injuries
- Evaluate baseline functioning for elderly individuals or patients with neurological conditions

For your app, a simplified version could include daily or weekly check-in questions, speech or typing-based memory/logical flow prompts, or passive data like delayed responses.
