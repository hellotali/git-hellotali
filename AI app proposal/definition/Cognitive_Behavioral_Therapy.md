# Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

## 🧠 Overview
**Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** is a **structured, time-limited form of psychotherapy** that helps people identify and change **unhelpful thoughts and behaviors**.

It’s based on the idea that:
- **Thoughts**, **feelings**, and **behaviors** are interconnected.
- Negative thought patterns can lead to emotional distress and harmful behaviors.
- By **challenging and reframing these thoughts**, people can improve their mood and coping skills.

## ⚙️ How CBT Works
1. **Identify negative or distorted thoughts** – e.g., “I always fail at everything.”
2. **Challenge those thoughts** – Look for evidence, alternative explanations, or more balanced views.
3. **Change behaviors** – Practice new coping skills and healthy habits.
4. **Reinforce positive patterns** – Build long-term resilience.
